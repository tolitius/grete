... and some Java API<br/>
... and the latest kafka (at the moment of writing)

the idea behind `grete` is to be able to start a farm of kafka consumers that listen to (potentially) multiple topics and apply a simple consuming function.

## spilling the beans

```clojure
$ make repl

=> (require '[grete.core :as g])
```

it is quite common for the same app to produce and consume,<br/>
hence we'll use one config for producing and consuming:

```clojure
=> (def config {:kafka
                {:producer
                 {:bootstrap-servers "1.1.1.1:9092,2.2.2.2:9092,3.3.3.3:9092"}
                 :consumer
                 {:group-id "foobar-consumer-group"
                  :bootstrap-servers "1.1.1.1:9092,2.2.2.2:9092,3.3.3.3:9092"
                  :topics ["foos" "bars" "bazs"]
                  :threads 42
                  :poll-ms 100
                  :auto-offset-reset "earliest"}}})
```

### produce

produce a couple of messages (to `foos` topic):

```clojure
=> (def p (g/producer (get-in config [:kafka :producer])))

;; send a couple of messages to topics: "foos" and "bars"
=> (g/send! p "foos" "{:answer 42}")
=> (g/send! p "bars" "{:answer 42}")

=> (g/close p)
```

### consume

a sample consuming function "`process`":

```clojure
;; the "process" function takes a batch of 'org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords'
;; which can be turned to a seq of maps with 'consumer-records->maps'"

=> ;; not using "consumer" arg here, but you may
   (defn process [consumer batch]
     (let [batch (g/consumer-records->maps batch)
           bsize (count batch)]
       (when (pos? bsize)
         (println "picked up" bsize "events:" batch))))
```

start a farm of consumers (`42` threads as per config):

```clojure
=> (def consumers (g/run-consumers process (get-in config [:kafka :consumer])))
```

once the "farm" is started you'll see those two messages that were produces above:

```clojure
;;   picked up 2 events: ({:value {:answer 42},
;;                         :key #object[[B 0x65ae581f [B@65ae581f],
;;                         :partition 2,
;;                         :topic foos,
;;                         :offset 1000,
;;                         :timestamp 1586888551200,
;;                         :timestamp-type CreateTime}
;;                        {:value {:answer 42},
;;                         :key #object[[B 0x499b3437 [B@499b3437],
;;                         :partition 13,
;;                         :topic foos,
;;                         :offset 3239,
;;                         :timestamp 1586889147336,
;;                         :timestamp-type CreateTime})
```

values here are strings, but could be byte arrays given bytearray de/serializers.

as with other thread pools, it's a good idea to shut them down once we done working with them:

```clojure
=> (g/stop-consumers consumers)
```

### callbacks

a kafka producer has an internal accumulator (kept in [Deque](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Deque.html)) where it stores all the events before sending them out to the server (a.k.a. broker). when it is ready to send them, it splits the events stored in the accumulator in batches (controlled by a "`batch.size`" prop) and sends them out batch by batch.

the wait time before the actual "publish | send" is controlled via a "`linger.ms`" producer configuration property that maintains the balance of latency vs. throughput.

hence the kafka publishing process is asynchronous by design.

once the events are published to the broker, kafka producer informs the calling API about the status via an optional _callback_.

this callback is a function that takes two arguments:

* `metadata` in a form of
```clojure
{:offset 42
 :partition 13
 :topic "eagle-nebula"}
```
* and, in case of a problem, an `exception`

this callback can be provided to a grete's `send-then!` function:

```clojure
=> (g/send-then! p "foos" "{:answer 42}"
     (fn [metadata exception]
       (println {:meta metadata
                 :exception exception})))

#object[org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.FutureRecordMetadata 0x753e4eb5 "org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.FutureRecordMetadata@753e4eb5"]
{:meta {:offset 2
        :partition 0
        :topic foos}
 :exception nil}

;; this part ðŸ‘† is returned to a producer via a callback
;; this part ðŸ‘‡ is returned to a consumer

picked up 1 events: ({:value {:answer 42}, :key nil, :partition 0, :topic foos, :offset 2, :timestamp 1701364230786, :timestamp-type CreateTime})
```

## Java API

consumer props:

```yaml
bootstrap-servers: "1.1.1.1:9092,2.2.2.2:9092,3.3.3.3:9092"
threads: 42
poll-ms: 10
topics: "foos,bars,bazs"
group-id: "foobar-consumer-group"
auto-offset-reset: "earliest"
enable-auto-commit: "false"
heartbeat-interval-ms: "3000"
default-api-timeout-ms: "600000"
session-timeout-ms: "30000"
```

a mesage processing function:

```java
static void process(ConsumerRecords<byte[], byte[]> records) {
   // ...
}
```

a map of consumers:

```java
import tolitius.Grete;

BiConsumer<KafkaConsumer, ConsumerRecords<byte[], byte[]>> consume =
        (consumer, records) -> process(records);

Map consumers = Grete.startConsumers(consume, props);

Grete.stopConsumers(consumers);
```

could be "`process(consumer, records)`" if "KafkaConsumer" is also needed

### several topics at once

In case the same group of consumer threads are listening to multiple topics _and_ the distinction needs to be made, i.e. what messages came from which topics, the records need to be groupped by topic:

```java
static Map<String, List<ConsumerRecord<byte[], byte[]>>> groupByTopic(ConsumerRecords<byte[], byte[]> records) {

    if (records.isEmpty()) {
        log.trace("no new records in kafka, hence there is nothing to transport");
        return null;
    }

    var byTopic = new ConcurrentHashMap<String, List<ConsumerRecord<byte[], byte[]>>>();

    records.forEach(record -> {
        var topic = record.topic();
        var rs = byTopic.getOrDefault(topic, new ArrayList<>());
        rs.add(record);
        byTopic.put(record.topic(), rs);
    });

    return byTopic;
}
```

this is the "`process`" function from a previous example with a group by topic:

```java
static void process(ConsumerRecords<byte[], byte[]> records) {

    // since consumer may be subscribed to multiple topics the batch might include
    // records of different types / from different topics.
    // group all the the records in the batch by the topic to later pipe it to the proper function
    var byTopic = groupByTopic(records);

    if (byTopic != null) {
        byTopic.forEach((topic, rs) -> {

            // ...
        });
    }
}
```
